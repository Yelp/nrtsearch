Match Phrase Query
==========================

A query that analyzes the text before finding matching documents. The tokens resulting from the analysis are combined into a Lucene PhraseQuery.

Proto definition:

.. code-block::

   message MatchPhraseQuery {
       string field = 1; // Field in the document to query.
       string query = 2; // The text to query with.
       int32 slop = 3; // Edit distance between respective positions of tokens generated by analyzing this query and the positions of terms in a document.
       Analyzer analyzer = 4; // Analyzer used to analyze the query. If not provided, the default search analyzer for the field would be used instead.
   }
