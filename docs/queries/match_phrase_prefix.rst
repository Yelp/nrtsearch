Match Phrase Prefix Query
==========================

A query that matches documents containing terms in the same order as those in the analyzed query string.
The final analyzed token is treated as a prefix and expanded to at most ``max_expansions`` terms.
The expansion process searches the field's sorted terms list, segment by segment, until enough terms with the prefix are found.

Proto definition:

.. code-block::

   // A query that matches documents containing terms in the same order as those in the analyzed query string. The final analyzed token is treated as a prefix.
   message MatchPhrasePrefixQuery {
       // Field in the document to query.
       string field = 1;
       // The text to query with.
       string query = 2;
       // Edit distance between respective positions of tokens generated by analyzing this query and the positions of terms in a document.
       int32 slop = 3;
       // Analyzer used to analyze the query. If not provided, the default search analyzer for the field would be used instead.
       Analyzer analyzer = 4;
       // Maximum number of terms to which the last provided term of the query value will expand. Defaults to 50.
       int32 max_expansions = 5;
   }
